- We will be using resource tagging per HPC Club cloud policy
  - Please see [this link](https://cloudmaven.github.io/documentation/ccs_student_research.html)
  - Each resource whether generated manually or automatically has a Project tag: Your UW NetID (not the @ part)
  - Also add a 'End_date' tag
  - Also add a 'Name' tag with netID_resource_purpose as the value field

- Central importance: Use Spot market
 
- AB can walk through most of this

- Until we figure out the plan better: You can authenticate with a NetID but we also grant admin access for IAM Role config work

- Create a cfncluster with a placement group

- disable hyperthreading if desired (not critical). 
  - This requires a config file and a post_install_script. (sent but may need to re-create)

- There is a cfncluster tutorial that can be helpful. (see email chain for links). 
 
- Install starccm+ on the shared volume and set up the license
  - There has been an execution problem; A is making progress on this
  - Please send Rob a confirmation this is working

- Create a snapshot of the volume (for the next cluster).
 
- create a qsub file and launch
  - The qsub file is created from starccm+ documentation
  - AWS does not generally know best practices for the individual software packages 
  - Therefore get this file from siemmens; and/or email backlog; please send to Rob
 
- number of processes requested (and hence the number of instances requested) depends on the number of gridcells in the CFD calculation 
  - LH targets about 50,000 cells per process. 
  - LH recollection: A's cases were small so only about 72 processes are required 
    - two c4.8xlarges, with hyperthreading turned on -- or four if it is turned off
  - Revised: 9e6 cells / 50k = 180 processors; so 4-5 c4.8xl
  - I checked the config file and it didn’t have placement groups so suggest a new cfncluster is needed
 
- Also running starccm+ with a batch or qsub file is documented in **The Steve’s portal** (starccm+ website). 
  - AWS does not generally have access to The Steve Portal so no recommended practices
