## Introduction

Cloud computing is here; like the PC and search engines the cloud is part of our technology landscape and it will be central to research 
computing for years to come, for three reasons: Time, time and time. First when you work on the cloud you stop spending time buying and 
working with computers.  Second the cloud has unlimited compute capacity with zero wait time. And third the cloud saves you time because 
other people are building the tools you need for you to use. 
Certainly these assertions lead to a deeper conversation; and there is more on this both 
[here at cloudmaven.org](http://cloudmaven.org "Cloud Maven") 
and (at a more introductory level) at 
[this University of Washington web page](https://itconnect.uw.edu/research/cloud-computing-for-research/ "UW IT Cloud for Research").
For the moment let's imagine that we're in agreement: The cloud is just the thing; let's move on to what cloudmaven is for... 

Are you looking to utilize data science tools and the cloud for your research? [Would that it were so simple!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rDw2YBUz6A) 
We've compiled a guide to help make your life easier. Navigation on the left. Go cloud crazy.
