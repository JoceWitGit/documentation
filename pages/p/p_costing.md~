## Warnings

## Overview
- Review your status and options with regard to cloud research credit grants. These are provided by (at least) 
Microsoft Azure and AWS. They can have a value of as much as $20,000 and a duration of 12 months. They are
considered non-renewable after that time. Having a research credit grant of this type is independent of writing
a grant proposal to a funding agency such as NIH or NSF. If such a grant is secured you may wish to reference
it in a proposal as a means of defraying computing costs in year one of the proposed effort. 

Research credit cloud accounts are distinct from paid accounts secured under the UW BAA with AWS and Azure. 
Those accounts have legal terms associated with them (see respective overview pages herein: 
[Azure overview](az_overiew) and [AWS overview](aws_overview.html).
