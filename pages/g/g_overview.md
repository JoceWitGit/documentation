## Introduction
The purpose of this page is to provide an overview of the **Google Cloud Platform**, which is
of course the Google public cloud. 

## Links
- [Google Cloud Platform](http://cloud.google.com)
- [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine)

## Warnings

## What we know

- We are working on building a relationship with and understanding of the Google cloud. 
- Our initial look indicates that cost of a Google VM instance compares *well* with that for 
an equivalent [AWS Spot market](aws_spot_market.html) VM instance. 
- Google has a unique approach to cloud computing that we feel will appeal to some
researchers; so while the content here is initially *in development / rudimentary*
we do encourage interested researchers to get in touch with us: Directly or using
**help** at uw dot edu.
