of course the Google public cloud. 

## Links

## Warnings

## What we know

- We are working on building a relationship with and understanding of the Google cloud. 
- Our initial look indicates that cost of a Google VM instance compares *well* with that for an equivalent 
[AWS Spot market](aws_spot_market.html) VM instance.
