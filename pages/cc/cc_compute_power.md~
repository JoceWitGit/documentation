## Introduction
The purpose of this page is to describe in some depth the available processing power on the public cloud. 

**There is an 'effectively unlimited' pool of computers available on the public cloud, a reservoir you can
tap to address your computing tasks.**

## Warnings

## Basic Thesis

We will need to build a framework for large computing tasks on the cloud. This includes drawing a distinction
between instance types which we refer to as cloud VMs (Virtual Machines). 
See our [overview page](cc_what_is_the_cloud) and our [glossary](cc_glossary) to cover the basics that 
are assumed here. 

## Machine characteristics and technical facets

- Distinction between metal and various VM configurations
- AWS view of things: GP, compute-intensive, memory-intensive
- Azure view of things
- GPU-centric
- X line
- Cores versus vCPUs versus nodes versus blades versus
- Attached drives; EBS and so on
- NFS
- interconnection speed
