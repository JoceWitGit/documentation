## PuTTY 

The Windows PC environment does not yet support the **ssh** command and consequently cloud VM connections typically
use the PuTTY application. (You may also look into 
[alternative options](http://web.archive.org/web/20130806071308/http://huddledmasses.org/scriptable-ssh-from-powershell/)). 
PuTTY is a slightly circuitous but perfectly reliable means of connecting with a cloud VM, supporting as it does several
communication protocols including ssh. 

The main thing to know is that a VM credential file with a .pem extension does not work with PuTTY. You can use the companion
application PuTTYgen to convert this file to an equivalent file with a .ppk file extension.  The PuTTY program can then use 
this credential file to connect to a cloud VM. 

kilroy need screencap of PuTTYgen in operation and the menu location for specifying a .ppk file.

kilroy need text and screencap showing use of PuTTY to accomplish the Jupyter tunnel given above; and copy to the all Jupyter pages as well.

Per Wikipedia, [**curl**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) is a command line tool for getting or sending files 
using [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator) syntax.
