## Introduction
The cloud is extremely secure provided that the research group learns and follows appropriate guidelines. Both AWS and Microsoft have HIPAA-aligned technology called out in respective Business Associate Agreements (BAAs). The burden of compliance is placed on the research team; and UW IT is working to make this progress feasible and straightforward.

## Access Control
In both AWS and Azure, Identity and Access Management enables you to manage user access to your cloud services and resources. That is to say, it allows you to be the gatekeeper. You can create users and groups and assign " depending on the level of access you want to authorize them for. More information on how to use the IAM console is elaborated in the procedural sections for each of the different cloud providers: [Azure](/azure_portal.html) or [AWS](/aws_console.html).
