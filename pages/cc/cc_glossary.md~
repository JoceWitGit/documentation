## Introduction

## Introduction
The purpose of this glossary is to provide you a research-oriented guide to some of the common terms used in cloud computing.  

## Links

## Warnings
***There are two listings here: Common terms followed by General glossary***
***Terms that refer to a specific cloud or technology may include a reference to that context in [square brackets]***
***All cost estimates are in US Dollars and should be independently verified. They have tended to decrease with time.
Listings here may become out of date.***

## Common Terms

AWS: Amazon Web Services: The public cloud provided by Amazon

Microsoft Azure: The public cloud provided by Microsoft Corporation

Google Cloud Platform: The public cloud provided by Google

IAM: Identity and Access Management

## General Glossary

Account administrator: A person with administrative privileges associated with a cloud account (i.e. a billing account).

Alarm: kilroy

AMI: Amazon machine image (AWS)

API Gateway:

Billing: kilroy

Blob storage: A storage entity on Azure.

Cloud account: A virtual entity with permission to use a particular public cloud with an associated billing mechanism. The cloud 
account is used to appropriate and release resources which have associated billing rates. For example a cloud account might 
include a virtual machine that runs continuously for one month at a rate of ten cents per hour. At the end of one month 
this resource would incur a $72 charge. 

Container: An abstraction in which a compute environment is placed. See 'Docker container'.

Data signal: A conceptual wire carrying information, typically backed up by physical hardware.

Docker container:  

[EBS](http://www.rightscale.com/blog/cloud-industry-insights/amazons-elastic-block-store-explained): Elastic Block 
Storage; disk memory associated with EC2 instances on AWS. Cost estimate $0.10 per (Gbyte-month)

EC2: Elastic Cloud Compute instance, a virtual machine on AWS

EFS: Elastic File System (AWS), similar to NFS. 

Elastic: Commonly used as shorthand for "available in large quantities on request" to emphasize that you can
allocate extensive computing resources on the cloud when needed and then relinquish them when no longer
needed. As an idealized example: Suppose a parallelizable compute job requires 100 hours on your machine. 
On the cloud you can appropriate 100 such computers at once and complete the job in 1 hour. 

IAM User: A user account created by an account administrator for specific use by a project participant.

Endpoint: A connection point for a data signal. 

GitHub AWS version: kilroy

Group: A virtual association of resources within a cloud account.

[HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act): Health insurance portability 
and accountability act. In short: A set of standards for securely managing Private Health Information (PHI).

IOT: Abbreviates 'Internet of Things', typically embedded devices that send and possibly receive information from 
some environment. This environment might for example be a computer lab, a street intersection, a hospital room, 
or a remote glacier.

Key pair: A means of accessing kilroy.

Lambda: An AWS service (dissociated from a VM) that can carry out a wide variety of activities under restriction 
of "must take a short amount of time".

MFA: Multi-Factor Authentication, a means of protecting resources

ML: Machine Learning, referring to a large class of methods in computer science which typically carry out 
classification tasks based on learned rules. Learning is either guided or unguided, meaning that either a 
test dataset with correct assignment information is used; or the algorithm simply operates on statistical 
distributions of data.

NIC: kilroy

The thing that is a NIC: kilroy

Policy: kilroy

Project: Shorthand for a body of work within a research program, assumed to have some computational elements.

RDS: Database service on AWS

Role: kilroy

S3: Storage on AWS

Scheduler kilroy

Server: A compute entity acting as a distal resource in a server-client relationship. Servers typically "listen" 
for particular signals and respond with the underlying infrastructure managing the "how" of these exchanges through 
a layering of technologies from wires and voltages up through communication protocols.

Snapshot

Spot Market kilroy

Thing: AWS, an entity that can have a Role.

Utility model: 

VM: Virtual machine (traditional term). We use the term here to indicate a computer; usually a computer 
operated by a public cloud vendor. On AWS a VM is called an EC2 instance. 

VPC: Virtual Private Cloud (AWS)
