## Introduction

This page is draft material for a paper on lightweight data systems: Something you build in eight
hours on the cloud that elevates your data from 'a mess' to 'a usable mess'... or still better 
'a usable organized mess' or dare we hope 'a usable organized mess that makes some sense'.


Our toolbox includes


- Existing data systems from AralDIF to NASA DAAC
- Web frameworks (Django, Flask, Bottle, ...)
- Code repos (GitHub, GitLab, ...)
- Jupyter notebooks
- The public cloud
  - Specifically cloud-hosted services that are free or cheap
  - Specifically cloud storage that is cheap

## Some organizing ideas


### Abstract?


We describe here a process of creating a data system within a research program which is implicitly about sharing, collaboration, 
reproducibility, and accelerated pace in data-driven science. This thesis is part of a shift in emphasis that borrows heavily from 
both commercial and open software development paradigms that we trace to one central idea: The lifespan and value of data are not 
intrinsically known at the outset (owing to the very nature of research) but in fact are commonly undervalued in traditional approaches 
to data curation.  There are several instructive contrasts between success criteria in research software development versus commercial 
software development versus open software development.  Here we borrow from these contrasts to illustrate the cultural and technical 
shift necessary to accomplish the normative assertion that the value of data can be better realized through the cultural shift of 
changing practices.  The research program has traditionally had as its end goal a peer-reviewed publication and this has contributed 
to the de facto conservative life expectancy of source data. The following postulates are the basis for the lightweight data system
framework presented here:


- Data-driven research can be roughly divided into exploratory and perfunctory tasks
- Open source solutions are built by software developers to solve common problems in a robust manner
- Open source solutions have lifespans related to their degree of success and usefulness
- Commercial software development is rigorous owing to the cost of failure
- Commercial software development is commonly managed by non-developers who perform important supporting tasks
- The public cloud is globally available as a powerful low-cost computing platform
- Each research domain has its own idiosyncratic formats, practices and tools
- Within and often across research domains -- despite idiosyncracies -- common objectives emerge in service to both perfunctory and exploratory tasks
- Time is a research group's primary and most valuable commodity; followed by qualified people; followed by funding
- The Scutero principle: Given the primacy of time: Never build any more than is absolutely necessary
  - Corollary: Work from design patterns 
  - Corollary: Be prepared to invest time learning what 'minimum necessary' actually is
  - Corollary: Design patterns are one step from cookbook recipes; which can reduce development time
- We Howe principle:  The Pyramid of human stability has a data-driven research analog which we develop and invert as follows
  - Base: Storage 
  - Upon the base: Sharing data
  - Upon sharing: Query
  - Upon query: Analytics
  - Upon analytics: Integration
  - Inversion: **Integration** from the outset is a project management strategy
    - Integration means making the connectivity between various moving parts of a project work together
      - The concept arose over countless failures where these interfaces generated friction 
      - Integration amounts to devoting careful thought to what the end result looks like, how it functions
      - Integration often involves two important human considerations: Use cases and stakeholders
      - The positive admonition would be 'Ignore integration at your peril'


- Any domain can generate a data to technology mapping that describes building a LWDS
  - Our emphasis here has been on geosciences
  - We might expand this paper to include genomics and something like neuroimagng
  - Regardless: We claim to cover only a fraction of the domain detail
    - With the idea that 'well begun is half done'
