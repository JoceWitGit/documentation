## Introduction

This page is draft material for a paper on lightweight data systems: Something you build in eight
hours on the cloud that elevates your data from 'a mess' to 'a usable mess'... or still better 
'a usable organized mess' or dare we hope 'a usable organized mess that makes some sense'.


Our toolbox includes

- Existing data systems from AralDIF to NASA DAAC
- Web frameworks (Django, Flask, Bottle, ...)
- Code repos (GitHub, GitLab, ...)
- Jupyter notebooks
- The public cloud
  - Specifically cloud-hosted services that are free or cheap
  - Specifically cloud storage that is cheap
