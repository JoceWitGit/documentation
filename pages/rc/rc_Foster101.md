## Objective/Abstract


This overview lecture introduces the public cloud computing environment in the context of our 
Research-centric mission; where we pivot to address cloud technology in the context of Enterprise computing.
Attendees will learn what comprises the cloud both in terms of core technologies and considering peripheral 
issues including cost management, data security, web frameworks, collaborative tools and cloud-related 
elements of project management.  Further details on course material and related resources may be found at
