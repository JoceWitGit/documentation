Date: Tuesday, Apr. 4, 2017

Location: University of Washington WRF Data Science Studio (6th floor of the Physics Astronomy tower) 

Website : http://cloudmaven.org/cloud101_immersion.html 
 
 
Objective: This one-day, hands-on immersion course will introduce participants to  three major cloud providers (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform) with two focused 'get stuff done' activities. First: Web framework building: Participants will learn to provision compute resources and build a lightweight system to encourage collaboration and data sharing. Second: Scale computing: Participants will be introduced to configuring and running tasks on the high performance computing (HPC) service on AWS. In this process participants will also learn to compare costs between different cloud providers and on-site computing infrastructure.
