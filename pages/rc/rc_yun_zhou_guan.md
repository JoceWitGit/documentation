## Introduction


The purpose of this page is to describe a cloud-based library -- a very small one -- that shows how 
the public cloud can be used as a tool for digital curation.


- We have a small initial set of 'proof of concept' resources 
  - LIDAR data
  - Genomics computation
  - BrainInfo: A neuroscience reference ontology
- The name of the library (Mandarin) means simply "cloud walk library"
