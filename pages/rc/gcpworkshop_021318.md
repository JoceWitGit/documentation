## Objective
This hands-on immersion course will introduce participants to the Google Cloud Platform.


We will focus on cloud computing terminology, creating a secure
environment for your work, costing the cloud in advance, and  granular
cost management as you go. We will demonstrate the basic process of
starting and configuring both virtual machines and cloud storage and
will overview other key mechanisms that help you translate your
computing
to the public cloud. We will also share a number of early-adopter
success stories.
