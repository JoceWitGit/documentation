## Course Outline 

- Welcome and logistics
- Introduction to cloud computing
  - Why does this matter to you (as a person in a business)
    - Not guessing capacity
    - Not waiting for infrastructure arrival / config
    - Faster time to market

    - You immediately have a global presence: Without buying data centers around the world 
    - If you are doing a start-up: You have the same access to resources that Netflix has
    - "Culture Eats Strategy" (people on board)
    - Be patient with Developers; consider as challenge in language bridging
    - The more you know technically the more your perspective will impact the process
    - Be aware that you can learn and evaluate trends: Agile, Test-Driven Development, the 12 Factor App, etc etc etc etc etc
    - The more jargon you learn... the crazier you will be (but also the saner)
