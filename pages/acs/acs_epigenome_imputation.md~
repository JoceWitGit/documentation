## Introduction
This page describes a methodology study in genomics to impute (computationally infer) information linking 
cell types, proteins and locations along the human genome. The study is currently in preparation as a 
research paper. The computation is done on the public cloud (both AWS and Azure platforms) using the 
Apache Spark computation framework.

- Link to the code

## Warnings
- ***You can use cloud-provider support for Apache Spark: e.g. Elastic Map Reduce on AWS. However AmpLab 
(the originators of Spark) also provide more direct solutions that can save you some money but require a 
bit of additional effort to configure.***


end part 1


- This imputes hypothetical results in silico in place of wet lab experiments.

- How much does one such physical wet lab experiment cost (i.e. one cell type, one protein assay, 3 billion base pairs)?
