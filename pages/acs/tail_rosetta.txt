The AWS research credits provided for this work have contributed significantly to the challenge of 
large scale sampling of peptide scaffolds -- stable structures that would be the basis for 
developing new therapeutics. The practical challenge is the matching of such structures to 
naturally occuring geometries of interest within the organism's molecular landscape, often 
described using a 'lock and key' analogy: A given therapeutic molecule could be designed to 
fit a particular binding site either enhancing or restricting some metabolic process. 
One ultimate aim then would be to comprehensively sample all possible shapes such that 
a large number of highly stable 'keys' are ready to be molded or slightly re-configured into 
any desired shape.
