## Project Description
The country of Nicaragua is set in a climatic zone subjected to extreme storm events that cause land slides and flooding. A goal of the government of Nicaragua for this project is to provide advanced warning systems and to explore different avenues of adaptation to future climate change. 

This work is highly motivated by the need to improve coherence in addressing the development of Nicaragua's rural landscape and exploring the important linkages between agriculture, water, land and food security. There exists various possibilities for tackling resource problems through multi-sectoral collaborations and interventions. Further, this project    

ra series of topography, soils, and landuse transitions set in a climatic zone subject to extreme storm events, with subsequent land slides and flooding. A goal of the Government of Nicaragua is to provide advanced warning systems and explore different avenues of adaptation to possible climate change outcomes.
 
This work is motivated by the need to improve coherence in addressing the development of Nicaragua’s rural landscape; the important linkages between agriculture, water, land, and food security, and therefore the possibilities for tackling multiple problems with multi-sectoral interventions; the unexplored potential for adopting existing diagnostic tools to test key hypotheses about future directions for Nicaragua’s development; and the need for targeting public financing to meet funding gaps in rural development. 
Objective(s) of the Assignment. The project will consist of four interrelated analytical pieces: (i) An evaluation of the geospatial information resources (topography, soils, landcover and landcover properties, and meteorological, infrastructure) available within agencies of Nicaragua, and international sources, (ii) Merging this information into dataframes, to prepare them for computer modelling of overall water resources, crossing borders when necessary for activities such as watershed analysis (iii) developing a computer model(s) of water sources, including facilitating deployment and visualizations in the Cloud, (iv) analyzing scenarios of current and future conditions. Further, the project will work with local institutions and stakeholders for training. Together, these activities create a “dynamic information framework” (DIF).
Specifically, the Consultant will be responsible for the development and application of the DIF, in concert with local agencies and stakeholders. The consultant will prepare and submit appropriate reports/documents/input throughout the study. 
Scope of Services, Tasks (Components) and Expected Deliverables.   The Consultant will undertake a landscape analysis of Nicaragua, within the context of a “dynamic information framework” for the country (Nicaragua DIF, or NicaDIF). The work will include development of geospatial information layers, including a 90-meter Digital Elevation Model (DEM, from SRTM), possibly a 10-30-meter DEM from local or international [I have been experimenting with Dave’s SHALSTAB model on the 30-meter SRTM data.] sources (relevant for disaster risk management) a soils map (local sources as provided, else FAO), landuse and landuse change maps (from local sources, Landsat) and MODIS, a regional climatology (from a climate re-analysis product), a preliminary evaluation of changes in total water storage (GRACE satellite; if determined feasible/useful), and incorporation of local knowledge (as provided by counterparts). Information products will be delivered by a website.
