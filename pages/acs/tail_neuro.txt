## Post-workshop evaluation 

A survey distributed on the last day of the workshop asked participants to comment on *delta-skills*
and *delta-learning* that occurred during the workshop. 

- How much knowledge about cloud computing did you have coming into Neurohackweek?

- How much did you learn about cloud computing during Neurohackweek?

Kilroy need some fill-in here!

In free form responses when asked "What did you learn?" several participants mentioned cloud computing. For example: 

- "Learned rudimentary python and javascript, got a refresher on git/github, was introduced to many new tools like cloud computing."

- "I learned how to use a bunch of tools I'd heard about but wasn't sure how to actually get working with my own data. I also 
worked with a great team to ask a scientific question using shared Jupyter notebooks on the AWS cloud." 

On the other hand several participants expressed frustration at not having enough time to learn more about these topics. 
When asked "What would you have liked to learn more about in Neurohackweek?", a few participants responded that more time 
should have been devoted to cloud computing. For example: 

- "I couldn't get the cloud computing to work and I would very much have liked to learn more about it (at a more basic level... 
perhaps in a format like the github lecture... step by step so anyone can follow along and everyone has accomplished executing 
the mission-critical steps)."

- "I wasn't able to absorb as much as I wanted about cloud computing. It was too much information for the limited time."

- "If we'd had more time it would have been nice to have known what other folk are working on. I also need more time to 
understand the cloud computing/storage/docker implementations."

## Conclusion

Incorporating cloud computing in Neurohackweek was a ‘multiple win’ proposition. It facilitated projects by providing simple access 
for the participants to key neuroimaging computational tools. It helped identify bottlenecks to fix in cloud use. By training 
the participants Neurohackweek advanced the cultural shift in building and sharing open analytical tools in domain research. 
Finally of course Neurohackweek helped build awareness of the strengths of cloud computing. 

UW IT Research Computing will continue to work with the event organizer Ariel Rokem and with this community to expand and solidify 
the contribution of cloud computing to this important research. This continuation will include provision of compute resources, hosting 
training sessions and supporting consultation with AWS solution architects. 
We encourage other research communities to contact us about following the Neurohackweek model for community-building in other 
respective domains.
