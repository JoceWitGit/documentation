## Introduction

## Warnings

## Start

- We will be using resource tagging per HPC Club cloud policy
  - Please see [this link](https://cloudmaven.github.io/documentation/ccs_student_research.html)
  - Each resource whether generated manually or automatically has a Project tag: Your UW NetID (not the @ part)
  - Also add a 'End_date' tag
  - Also add a 'Name' tag with netID_resource_purpose as the value field

- Central importance: Use Spot market
 
- AB can walk through most of this
