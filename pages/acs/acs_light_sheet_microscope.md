## Cloud 


- Increase output rate on the computer connected to the microscope camera
- Increase the bandwidth in the telco closet to the vertical pipe to the basement
- Increase the bandwidth on the basement switch to the campus backbone
- Test the link
- Test the link from Health Sciences (relocate the microscope)
- Supposing the microscope-to-AWS-S3 link is working: Get the processing running quickly
