## Introduction

The purpose of this page is to describe a particular **hackathon** event -- one concerned with neuroscience -- in relation to
cloud computing. We describe provisioning of accounts, providing participant access, monitoring resources and evaluating total
cost. The underlying idea is a reversal of the usual cloud scalability model, to wit: The public cloud is a natural environment 
for supporting a burst in the number of available scientists.
