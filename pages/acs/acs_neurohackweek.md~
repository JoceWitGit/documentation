## Introduction

The purpose of this page is to describe a particular **hackathon** event -- one concerned with neuroscience -- in relation to
cloud computing. We describe provisioning of accounts, providing participant access, monitoring resources and evaluating total
cost. The underlying idea is a reversal of the usual cloud scalability model, to wit: The public cloud is a natural environment 
for supporting a burst in the number of available scientists.

### Background

Neurohackweek is an annual 5-day workshop held at the University of Washington eScience Institute.
The workshop convened more than 40 participants: graduate students, post-docs, faculty and research staff from all over the US and from the 
UK and the Netherlands, from Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science and other fields. The workshop was structured as part conference, 
part summer school and part hackathon. During the week participants took part in workshops and tutorials, presented their work in talks, 
and worked in small teams on projects or *hacks* where results were presented at the end of the week. 

### Future plans 

UW IT Research Computing will continue to work with the event organizer Ariel Rokem and with this community to expand and solidify 
the contribution of cloud computing to this important research. This continuation will include provision of compute resources, hosting 
training sessions and supporting consultation with AWS solution architects.
