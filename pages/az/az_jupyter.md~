# Jupyter notebooks on Microsoft Azure

## Introduction

The purpose of this page is to present the Microsoft Azure Jupyter notebook hosting service as an extremely 
valuable (currently free) tool for research.  

In general we advocate using Jupyter notebooks to create research sandboxes, to develop paper content, 
to share reproducible results, and to communicate on a technical level. Jupyter notebooks support 
Python, R, F Sharp, Julia and other programming languages. They also support markdown including LaTeX mathematical formatting.

Microsoft to their immense credit has created a Jupyter notebook hosting service on their Azure cloud platform. This has two 
advantages over hosting a Jupyter notebook on a machine that you manage: First Azure takes care of the basics of managing the 
notebook and its host machine; so you don't.  Second the Azure Jupyter notebook is connected to other useful technogies;
so it is already built into a broader technical context or ecosystem. These extensions include Azure Machine Learning Studio 
and GitHub, just to begin with. We believe this service has a great future and is well worth your time exploring.

## Warnings

***
Some UW people have had difficulty accessing their Azure Jupyter notebooks. This is apparently due to a UW permission policy
and it can be circumvented by using a non-UW-NetID Windows Live account.
***
*** 
Azure hosting of Jupyter is under development so be prepared to shoot them a 'help!' email. The other important
thing to realize is that from a Python cell you can issue a Linux command using '!command'. In particular the
link above on data loading tells you how to use !curl to load data from GitHub; and you may also want to
avail yourself of '!conda install' at the top of a particular notebook to make sure your added libraries are in place.
