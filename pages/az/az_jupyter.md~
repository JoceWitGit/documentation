# Jupyter notebooks on Microsoft Azure

## Introduction

The purpose of this page is to present the Microsoft Azure Jupyter notebook hosting service as an extremely 
valuable (currently free) tool for research.  

In general we advocate using Jupyter notebooks to create research sandboxes, to develop paper content, to share
reproducible results, and to generally communicate from a technical perspective. Jupyter notebooks support Python, R,
F-Sharp and other programming languages. They also support markdown including mathematical formatting (LaTeX). Microsoft to their
immense credit has created a Jupyter notebook hosting service on their Azure cloud platform. This has two advantages over 
hosting a Jupyter notebook on a machine that you manage: First they take care of the basics of managing the notebook; you never
have to worry about the host machine. (The service is free for now (January 2017); it may become a paid service in the future.)
Second: The Azure Jupyter notebook is connected to other important technogies for you; so it is really part of a broader 
technical ecosystem. These extensions include Azure Machine Learning Studio and GitHub, just to begin with. We believe this
service has a great future and is well worth your time exploring.

## Warnings

***
Some UW people have had difficulty accessing their Azure Jupyter notebooks. This is apparently due to a UW permission policy
and it can be circumvented by using a non-UW-NetID Windows Live account.
