Managers: Please forward this announcement as appropriate within your organization.

Microsoft is offering a free, hands-on, cloud computing training course in partnership with the eScience Institute at the University of Washington. Whether it's big data, big compute (HPC), machine learning with GPUs, or analyzing data streaming from devices for an IoT project, you can see how easy it is using Microsoft Azure to help you streamline and accelerate your data-driven science.
  
* When: January 19th, 2017
* Where: University of Washington WRF Data Science Studio (6th floor of the Physics Astronomy tower)

Follow on: You can apply for 12 months of significant Azure access through the Azure for Research Awards program. Apply by 15 February 2016 (and every two months thereafter) at http://www.azure4research.com.

During the training: You will be able to access Microsoft Azure on you own laptop. You will have access for evaluation purposes for up to one month afterwards. You do not need to have the Microsoft Windows operating system installed on your laptop, as Microsoft Azure is accessed via Internet browser,  Linux/Mac/Windows command-line and programming language APIs. 

This course is for Faculty, researchers, and students using any language, framework, or platform. This includes Linux, Python, R, MATLAB, Java, Hadoop, STORM, SPARK, and Microsoft technologies such as C#, F#, Microsoft .NET, Microsoft Azure SQL Database, and various Microsoft Azure services. 

We hope to see you there; and please forward this announcement on to your research colleagues.  

Many thanks,
Rob Fatland (rob5@uw.edu), 
Amanda Tan (UW Research Computing) 
and the Microsoft Azure For Research team
