## Before we begin...

- ***Managers: Please forward this announcement as appropriate within your organization.***
- ***You can secure a test/free-trial account on Azure and begin to explore the above training materials on your own***

## Overview

Microsoft offers a free, hands-on, cloud computing training course in partnership with the eScience Institute at the University of 
Washington. Whether it's big data, big compute (HPC), machine learning with GPUs, or analyzing data streaming from devices for an 
IoT project: You will see how easy it is using Microsoft Azure to help you streamline and accelerate your data-driven science. 

- When: January 19th, 2017
- Where: University of Washington WRF Data Science Studio (6th floor of the Physics Astronomy tower)

Follow on: You are invited to apply for 12 months of significant Azure access through the Azure for Research Awards program. 
Apply by 15 February 2017 (and every two months thereafter) at the [Azure for Research website](http://www.azure4research.com)

During the training: You will be able to access Microsoft Azure on your own laptop. You will have access for evaluation 
purposes for up to one month afterwards. You do not need to have the Microsoft Windows operating system installed on 
your laptop, as Microsoft Azure is accessed via Internet browser, Linux/Mac/Windows command-line and programming language APIs. 

This course is for Faculty, researchers, and students using any language, framework, or platform. This includes Linux, Python, 
R, MATLAB, Java, Hadoop, STORM, SPARK, and Microsoft technologies such as C#, F#, Microsoft .NET, Microsoft Azure SQL Database, 
and various Microsoft Azure services.
