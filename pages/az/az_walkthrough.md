## Introduction

This page is intended to provide a researcher with an introductory *walkthrough* view of the Microsoft Azure cloud.
We highly endorse using this cloud and its associated technology stack, particularly owing to the Visual 
Studio development environment and the high level services Azure provides such as the Machine Learning Studio.

## Warnings
*** 
The first common mistake in viewing Azure is that it does not support Linux; which is not the case at all. The Azure platform
has extensive support for Linux.
