## Introduction

This page is intended to give you--a researchers--an introductory *walkthrough* perspective upon entering the world of the 
Microsoft Azure cloud. We highly endorse using this cloud and its associated technology stack, particularly the Visual 
Studio development environment and the high level services such as the Azure Machine Learning Studio.

## Warnings

If you are going to make use of the ***completely awesome*** hosted Jupyter notebooks from Azure... and if you are working 
from a UW account: ***You may run into an application consent disabled problem that prevents you from editing your Jupyter 
notebook content. See the section below on Jupyter notebooks for more on this.*** (The simplest workaround is to use a 
Windows Live ID that has no connection with the University of Washington. However this has the drawback of being one 
more identity to remember / manage.)

## Jupyter notebook hosting

Azure is hosting Jupyter notebooks. These run on demand and when they shut down (e.g. time out) they may evaporate 
any data files you have uploaded. But aside from this limitation (which may be remedied) they are pretty darn cool; 
so we encourage you to try them out and see if they work for you. 

If you try and use this hosted service using your UW NetID you may run into an *application consent disabled* problem. 
Go to [this web page](https://itconnect.uw.edu/wares/msinf/aad/apps/) to submit an admin consent request under 
**Azure AD applictations which require admin approval**. This is one workaround until such time as the policy 
changes. You can also simply use a Windows Live ID that has no association with UW.
