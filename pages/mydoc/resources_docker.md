## Introduction to Docker Containers

Think of docker containers as self-contained software kits where dependencies, libraries and tools are wrapped up in one package so that they are environment independent. This documentation will (when completed) discuss how to get your software packaged into a container and deploy it on a cloud server. 

We're still working on this documentation. In the meantime, you can find out more about Docker [here](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)
