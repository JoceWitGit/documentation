## Introduction
The purpose of this document -- available [here](http://cloudmaven.org "Cloud Maven technical website") -- is to introduce you to cloud computing as
a research platform. The University of Washington has introductory material 
[here](https://itconnect.uw.edu/research/cloud-computing-for-research/ "Intro to cloud computing for research").
