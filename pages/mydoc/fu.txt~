## Evaluation 
In addition, in a survey conducted on the last day of the workshop all participants were surveyed for their skills 
entering the workshop and for the learning that occurred during the workshop. These included, on cloud: 

How much knowledge about cloud computing did you have coming into Neurohackweek?

How much did you learn about cloud computing during Neurohackweek?

In free form responses, when asked "What kind of things did you learn at Neurohackweek?" several participants mentioned cloud 
computing. For example: 

"Learned rudimentary python and javascript, got a refresher on git/github, was introduced to many new tools like cloud computing."

"I learned how to use a bunch of tools I'd heard about but wasn't sure how to actually get working with my own data. I also 
worked with a great team to ask a scientific question using shared jupyter notebooks on the amazon cloud." 

On the other hand, several participants expressed frustration at not having enough time to learn more about these topics. 
When asked "What would you have liked to learn more about in Neurohackweek?", a few participants responded that more time 
should have been devoted to cloud computing. For example: 

"I couldn't get the cloud computing to work and I would very much have liked to learn more about it (at a more basic level... 
perhaps in a format like the github lecture... step by step so anyone can follow along and everyone has accomplished executing 
the mission-critical steps)."

"I wasn't able to absorb as much as I wanted about cloud computing. It was too much information for the limited time."

"If we'd had more time it would have been nice to have known what other folk are working on. I also need more time to understand 
the cloud computing/storage/docker implementations."

## Conclusion
Incorporating cloud computing in Neurohackweek was a ‘multiple win’ proposition. It facilitated projects by providing simple access 
for the participants to key neuroimaging computational tools. It helped identify bottlenecks to fix in cloud use. By training 
the participants Neurohackweek advanced the cultural shift in building and sharing open analytical tools in domain research. 
Finally of course Neurohackweek helped build awareness of the strengths of cloud computing. As noted we consider this an excellent 
starting point with strong continuation efforts to follow. We encourage other research communities to contact us about following 
the Neurohackweek model for community-building in other respective domains.
