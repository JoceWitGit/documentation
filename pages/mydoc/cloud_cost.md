## Introduction
This page will expand on the cost of putting your research on the cloud, how you can leverage existing cloud resources and credits for benchmark and sandbox and other tips and tools for managing costs. 
 
## How much does the cloud cost?
The fast answer is “3 cents per GB-month of storage and 3 cents for an hour of CPU time”. That is an answer we will qualify and expand on; but just to get you started…

When you purchase a computer you are (apparently) done paying for it and you can use it until it fails; hopefully for 2 or more years. Then you need to purchase another computer. This is the traditional computing model and it makes sense if your machines are adequate to your computing needs provided that someone can pay for the electricity and cooling and someone has the time to maintain the operating system; and provided you have a good back-up strategy in case something bad happens. Cloud computing costs money but eliminates a lot of these ongoing maintenance tasks. Cloud computing resources are billed using a utility model: You pay for what you use.

Cost is managed by turning off resources when they are not in use; and by carefully managing how many machines are in use when running jobs. Both of these tasks can be associated with automatic alarms that can prevent cloud usage from getting out of control and expensive.

See also the section below on cloud research credits, a way to mitigate the cost of learning if the cloud works for you.

## Cloud Research Credits
There are at least four approaches open to you:

Cloud novice approach: Get a $100 free credit account on AWS or a $200 free credit account on Microsoft Azure. Both require you to enter credit card info. This is like giving your hotel your credit card in case you break the TV.

You need some substantial compute power Today: Contact us by email. We may be able to quickly (within a few hours) set you up with a temporary User account. You will need to coordinate your usage with us; we will need to make sure you are ‘good to go’ managing resources; and we will ask that you do some reporting on your experience. This can be a short-term stop-gap if you’re stuck. 

You need some serious compute power for a year at no cost (requires 2 months to set up): Fill out the one-page application here for AWS or the one-page application here for Microsoft Azure. On approval you can receive up to $20k in research credits for a year. Both public clouds are excellent so we do not recommend one over the other. Come visit our office hours if you would like to disucss relative merits further.

You need some serious compute power and you have a budget: Contact UW IT to set up a purchase order. This will take a couple of days.
