## Cornell Cloud Forum Notes

![Forum website](http://cio.cornell.edu/community/itcornell-community-conferences/cloud-forum-2016)

Temporarily I am placing notes from the Cornell Cloud Forum Nov 8--9 2016 right here.

* First speaker is Gerard Shockley from Boston Univeristy; he covered the breakdown of information from the survey
** Of particular interest were the remarks on Exit and Entrance strategies; and HIPAA
* Second speaker from Notre Dame
** Very low-key individual
