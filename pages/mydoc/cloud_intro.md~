## Introduction
The purpose of this document -- available [here](http://cloudmaven.org "Cloud Maven technical website") -- is to introduce you to cloud computing as
a research platform. 

## Some useful links

* The University of Washington has introductory material 
[here](https://itconnect.uw.edu/research/cloud-computing-for-research/ "Intro to cloud computing for research").
* True Cost of Ownership (TCO) is an important (kilroy: add spreadsheet info) factor and you can explore 
that specifically in the AWS framework [here](https://awstcocalculator.com/).
* If you are interested in using Python to control your AWS computing environment: 
Look into the [boto SDK](http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "Boto 3")
* AWS EC2 instance [descriptions](http://cloudmaven.org "kilroy") 
and [on-demand rates](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand "AWS EC2 on-demand rates")

## Geohackweek UW Cloud Intro November 17 2016

This presentation is from the view of a cloud computing advocacy team at UW Research Computing. 
You can reach us at rob at uw dot edu and amandach at uw dot edu.

* Your goal is the same as our goal: Focus on the science.
* CC is successful only when it disappears; it is showing every sign of succeeding.
* If you have challenges in your research computing: You may need to make some changes.
	* If you are the Red Queen you may perceive that you do not have time...
	* This talk is intended to give you a Framework for thinking about cloud computing

## Cloud Computing Framework Elements

* Research in the Data Deluge Era = perfunctory + exploratory
	* GDS

* Cloud pillars (sounds dubious) are compute, storage, network, data management and Services
	
* Cloud management pillars are identity, authentication, security, cost, and training

* Cloud practice pillars are Build, Test, Share 
	* And here at UW IT we have some more notes and suggestions

* Beware Geeks...
	* Hey I just put my Jupyter Notebook on the cloud
	* More accurately it is a fractal wild west
		* http://cloudmaven.org has an entry on installing Jupyter on the cloud
		* Oh but there is a nohup gotcha
		* Oh but there is a kernel patch gotcha
		* Oh ...

# Let us go then, you and I, briefly into the jargon abyss

* Third Party
* Stack Overflow
* YouTube
* AWS
* Azure
* S3 / Blob
* EC2: Tim and Tychele
* IAM
* EBS
* RDS
* AMI
* Exit Strategy
* HTC
* HPC and CFD and the Law of Moore
* IOT


## Cornell Cloud Forum Notes
Forum website is [here](http://cio.cornell.edu/community/itcornell-community-conferences/cloud-forum-2016 "Cornell Cloud Forum 2016")

Temporarily I am placing notes from the Cornell Cloud Forum Nov 8--9 2016 right here.

* First speaker is Gerard Shockley from Boston Univeristy; he covered the breakdown of information from the survey
	* Of particular interest were the remarks on Exit and Entrance strategies; and HIPAA

* Second speaker is Sharif Nijim from Notre Dame
	* Very low-key individual

* Panel discussion
	* Bob Winding Notre Dame
	* Gerard Shockly Boston University
	* Laurie Collinsworth Cornell University
	* Ben Rota Harvard University
	* From the "Future State" slide and related discussion
		* CloudFront WAF
		* VPC Mirror port
		* VDI in the cloud
		* Authentication in the cloud
		* IPS/IDS Palo Alto
		* Trying to avoid choke points
		* Can't replicate AWS tools/facilities; so use those first and augment
		* "We're just trying to solve the learning curve problem."

* Lightning Rounds: Introduced by Jim Behm University of Michigan
	* Phil Robinson (Cornell): Student services IT (SSIT) 
	* Jeff Gumpf: AWS workspaces for grad students
		* Kilroy Absolutely have to pursue this with Nancy / STF Pool A plan
			* $80 per student per ? time ?
	* Susan Kelley (Yale): Bringing IT Partners on campus along for the ride
	* Bob Winding: Research data security NIST 800-171 compliance in GovCloud (ITAR information)
	* Brett Haranin: Cloud adoption, a developer's perspective (skipped)
	* Ben Rota (Harvard): Cost engineering in AWS
	* Scotty Logan: Dirty dancing in the cloud
	* Rob Fatland: Research cloud computing garden path success stories
	* Erik Mitchell: Library and NoSQL
		* UCLA and UC Berkeley; 378e6; NoSQL
	* Sara Jeanes: Cloud contracts and procurement
	* Shawn Bower: The meaning of DevOps
	* Dave (Cornell)
		* access control and mutual bursting
			* https://www.cac.cornell.edu/services/cloudservices.aspx
			* https://federatedcloud.org/

* Mark Fischer talk: Automation on AWS
	* Codify infrastructure decisions
	* Document in code and so on
	* Have a process...
	* And here are our three patterns for solving problems
		* cloud formation template: How to create (and destroy) resources
			* JSON, stack... fire it off with CLI or API or console
			* Create Stack is the button you want to get to in the console
			* Delete Stack is another nice thing... "did I really delete everything I needed to?" > Yes!
			* Configuration as code: Version control! 
		* docker: For environment configuration (to avoid go install all of these packages)
		* Jenkins: DevOps gap-filling glue. "Continuous integration (CI) tool"
			* check out a git repo
			* build a Java app
			* integrate with slack / email / ... 
			* Kilroy worth a look I think: We should understand what all Jenkins can do... "warr files"?
				* Could this be Brian Warr? Probably not.

* Sharif Nijim on moving a Windows-oriented DMS to AWS

* Panel on ERPs in the Cloud: Enterprise Resource Planning (Workday and the like)
	* Jim Behm, University of Michigan
	* David McCartney, Ohio State
	* Glenn Blackler, University of California, Santa Cruze
	* Erik Lundberg, University of Washington

* Stanford talk on security standards and related
	* Bruce Vincent
	* Scotty Logan
		* As last year: We should steal (kilroy) everything this guy does
	* Xueshan Feng 
	* Jim Laney, Rupert Burke (kilroy) at UW IT might be interested in these links
	* https://minsec.stanford.edu/ Stanford's prescriptive system security guidelines
	* http://dataclass.stanford.edu/ is the Stanford classification system
