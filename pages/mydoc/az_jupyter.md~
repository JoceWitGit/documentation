# Jupyter notebooks on Microsoft Azure

## Jupyter on Azure
Microsoft Azure is hosting Jupyter notebooks. See http://notebooks.azure.com. You will create the source copy using a Windows Live ID.
These you can share by URL where other people can clone what you have built (without affecting your copy). 

## Warnings
*** UW NetID identity may not have proper access so test this and if you encounter problems: Start the Jupyter notebook from an alternative ID.***
