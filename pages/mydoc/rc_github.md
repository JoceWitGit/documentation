# GitHub for Research Computing

## Introduction

The purpose of this page is to walk through GitHub procedures with two implementations in mind: 

1. A Jekyll implementation (e.g. http://cloudmaven.org) that renders markdown (.md) properly. 
2. A Jupyter Notebook: Both static rendering and as a backup of a dynamic instance.

Using a code repository (distinguish: not a data repository) like GitHub accomplishes: 

- You have a safe back-up of your code base
- You can work on your code with others simultaneously, managing versions
- You can take advantage of interpreters like Jekyll that build documentation pages
- You can maintain versions of your code for development, testing and deployment (use)
