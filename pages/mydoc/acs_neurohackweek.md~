# AWS at Neurohackweek 2016 

### University of Washington eScience Institute

### By Ariel Rokem and Rob Fatland

## Summary
Neurohackweek ran September 5--9 2016 at the UW eScience Institute with 40+ attendees; with a strong emphasis on team projects built into the agenda. 
Four of these team projects made use of cloud computing resources provided by UW IT to great effect as described below. UW IT Research Computing will 
continue to work with the event organizer Ariel Rokem and with this community to expand and solidify the contribution of cloud computing to this 
important research. This continuation will include provision of compute resources, hosting training sessions and supporting consultation with AWS solution 
architects. 

## Background
Neurohackweek is an annual 5-day workshop held at the University of Washington eScience Institute held this year on September 5th-9th (2016). 
The workshop convened more than 40 participants: graduate students, post-docs, faculty and research staff from all over the US and from the 
UK and the Netherlands, from Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science and other fields. The workshop was structured as part conference, 
part summer school, and part hackathon. During the week, participants took part in workshops and tutorials, presented their work in talks, 
and worked in small teams on projects or *hacks*, with results presented at the end of the week.
