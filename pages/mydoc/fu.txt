* SNS topic notifies me when last instance shuts down.
  * Run Ansible script to configure Ws (patch, get data file names from DynamoDB table, etcetera)
  * Get Ws the Key from E
  * The Ws send an Alert through the NAT gateway to Simple Notification Service (SNS) 
    * Which uses something called SES to send an email 'system is working on PHI data'. 
      * Ws pull data from S3 using VPC Endpoint; thanks to the Route table
      * Ws decrypt data using HomerKey
      * Ws process their data into result files: Encrypted EBS volume. 
      * Optionally the result files are encrypted in place in the EBS volume.
  * Through the VPC Endpoint the results are moved to S3.
  * Ws send an Alert through the NAT gateway to Simple Notification Service (SNS) 
    * which uses something called SES to send another email: 'We're done now.'
  * Ws evaporate completely leaving no trace. 
  * B returns to quiescent state. 

## Procedure

We use the name 'czarhipaa'; this should be unique.

CIDR as shown is typical.

Dedicated Instance means: Nobody else allowed here. 

Now it exists; time to fill it with stuff.

### Pro Tip
You can be more cost-effective by not making this Dedicated but then your PHI-Using instances will have to be launched Dedicated. 
This is carte blanche Dedicated and so is more expensive. We do not consider this option in this tutorial because we are erring on 
the side of caution rather than cost. 


Next: Create a subnet

Public subnet addresses will be of the form: 10.0.0.2, .3, .4, ... .254

Take note of the AZ: 

We could do multiple public sub-nets by creating more than one in multiple Azs; that is a big-time concept.

Now the private one: 

Attach it to the VPC: 

Now for the NAT Gateway

Choose the public one in czarhipaa

Notice we Created a New EIP

Now the Route Table

Here they are (including the default main one): 

Edit and modify as shown:

Save

And then under Subnet Associations tab: Edit: 

Now let's go back to the Route Table selector…

And now Subnet Associations tab:
