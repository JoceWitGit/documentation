## Overview
Here is what you need to do: 

1. Set up your account to have "all green checkmarks". This means you are logged out and back in as an *admin*.
2. Start and Stop an EC2 instance: Know what it costs, what EBS is, and log in to it before you Stop it.
3. Study up on cloud tech, enough to understand cost, security and capacity; and then make a plan.
