## Introduction
The purpose of this document -- available at http://cloudmaven.org -- is to present a common experience:  "First day using the AWS cloud". 
The idea is that by capturing a walkthrough and some of the related thoughts and goals you will have a guided path into the basics of using
the cloud. This in turn gets you back to doing research as quickly as possible while still making sure that your cloud account is well-managed:
It is secure, it is cost-effective, and it has scalable compute resources that become available when you need them and that go away whey you
are done with them. 

Our narrative follows a graduate student Pearl. She has a large amount of data processing in mind for her work and she has written some 
necessary software in Python. There is more on this below. She wants to get going on the cloud; but she is also the default account 
administrator for her research team.
