## Hydrology and Geochemistry

- GDS: Geometabolomic Data System, a contribution-driven collaborative library for Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) spectral data from the global hydrosphere.
- HiMAT (NASA)
- Dynamic Infomation Framework (DIF)(World Bank): Converting scientific modeling skill into actionable information in 
the public domain: Central and southeast Asia, central and south America

## Genomics

- Epigenome imputation: From existing wet lab experiments *infer* relationships between 
particular proteins and cell types as a function of location on the human genome
- Genetic architecture of autism
- Metagenomics of methane-consuming microbial communities

## Library science

- With Suzzallo library: A pilot study for providing geospatial LIDAR data as a curated digital resource
- The curation and provision of cloud-based resources for data analysis in specialized research domain communities 

## Molecular Engineering and Science

- Peptide therapeutics research: Cloud-based scale computing using the Rosetta molecular folding analysis toolkit

## Ocean science

- LiveOcean: Ocean modeling forecast

- Mesoscale eddie structure and correlation to marine life

## Computer Science

- Analysis of code fault detection: Student project
- IOT: A design pattern and tutorial for using cloud-based support of **Internet of Things** implementations 
(NSF: Campus Cyberinfrastructure)
- Data security on the cloud: A generic data system with automated and human protocols for working on sensitive
data including elements of compliance with oversight regulations 
(NSF: Campus Cyberinfrastructure)
- Scale on the cloud: See under Molecular Engineering and Science the protein folding case study
(NSF: Campus Cyberinfrastructure)
- Collaboration on the cloud: See case studies herein on GeoServer/THREDDS, on LIDAR, on Dynamic Information 
Frameworks and on HiMAT; thematically lightweight geospatial data system with the underlying theme of 'access 
to data through pre-built frameworks, data APIs and minimal (non-redundant) software engineering.
(NSF: Campus Cyberinfrastructure)
