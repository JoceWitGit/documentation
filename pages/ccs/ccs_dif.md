## Introduction 

This page describes the translation of scientific skill to public value, specifically in water resource
management and related impacts on human communities. We are building a Dynamic Information Framework (DIF) 
that is implemented on a region-by-region basis to provide both data and machinery in a transparent
manner that contributes to the process of resource management and planning.

## Overview

![DIF0001](/documentation/images/ccs/ccs_DIF0001.png)

This figure shows a simplified version of the DIF vision with one modeling component, the VIC hydrological model.
The overall program for DIF can be summarized on a per-geographical-region basis:

- Begin with A hydrological model that incorporates observed data; train it to produce accurate results.
- Run the model into the future based on climate-change based extrapolation.
- Provide the source data through an open web interface
- Provide the results / output data through an open web interface
- Provide the software via an open repository like GitHub
- Provide documentation
- Repeat
