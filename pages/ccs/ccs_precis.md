## Introduction 


This page concisely describes public cloud use for research computing and data science at the University of Washington. 


We track close to 100 research projects using the public cloud for computing across issues of access, time, compute
power, storage, data management, cost and other issues.  The summary below is organized by domain. 
Our work in consulting and advocating for use of the public cloud is integrated with the mission and operation of
the UW eScience Institute.

## General Systems and Tools


- [SQL Share](https://sqlshare.uw.edu): A system for managing, sharing and manipulating research data.
- [Myria](http://myria.cs.washington.edu/): A distributed, shared-nothing Big Data management system and Cloud service from the University of Washington
- IOT based on Arduino Yun leaf technology and cloud IOT endpoint services
- Geohackweek and Neurohackweek: Hosting intensive workshops for learning and developing cloud-based tools and methods at UW


## Student-driven research


The UW Student High Performance Computing Club has begun making cloud computing available to its members. This includes 
training and consulting on implementation as well as careful cost management and tracking. The following is a partial list
of projects undertaken by students during the pilot phase of this program, spring 2017.


- Epigenome imputation across a nucleotide-protein-cell tensor (Status: Successful completion)
- Design of a high-reliability micropump for cooling high-heat semiconductors (In progress)
- Novel peptide characterization of marine organic matter: insights into carbon cycling (In progress)
- Characterizing the progression of three pathologies in ER electronic medical records (In progress)
- Quora question pair intent comparison (In progress)
- Novel peptide characterization of marine organic matter: insights into carbon cycling (In progress)
- Schedular development and benchmarking for containerized bioinformatics workflows (UW Tacoma; in progress)
- Empirical Studies of Docker Orchestration Tools for The Analyses of Big Biomedical Data (UW Tacoma; in progress)
- Predictive models to optimize cloud computing using genomics data (UW Tacoma; in progress)
- A Dynamic Scaling Engine in the Cloud (CSE; in progress)
- LaraDB Experiments for the DARPA Graph Challenge (CSE; in progress)
- Learning multiple outcomes with predictive coding (CSE; in progress)
