## Introduction 


This page concisely describes public cloud use for research computing and data science at the University of Washington. 


We track close to 100 research projects using the public cloud for computing across issues of access, time, compute
power, storage, data management, cost and other issues.  The summary below is organized by domain. 
Our work in consulting and advocating for use of the public cloud is integrated with the mission and operation of
the UW eScience Institute.



## CC*IIE Remarks



### What are the impacts of the CC*IIE (NSF) sponsored projects? How has it contributed?


#### Preamble 


Much of the impact of this work is speculative. The general topic is public cloud computing applied
to research computing, broken down into smaller segments of work. These efforts were motivated as 
contributions to specific projects; and we comment on their impact on those projects. However the 
work was also carried out with the idea of solving broader recurring challenges.  For example we 
developed a push notification of cloud spending on AWS to catch unauthorized account use and runaway
resource allocation by student researchers; but this was in view of the fact that any research 
groupd taking advantage of the AWS cloud will benefit from the same mechanism. At-a-glance cost
summaries that arrive by email are easy to monitor in contrast with *every day* logging in to a 
cost tracking console and configuring a set of queries. The former process takes a matter of seconds, 
the latter requires 15 minutes.

A note on scale: The group responsible for the cloud adaptation work described here as supported by
NSF is tasked with supporting the entirety of University of Washington research including medicine. 
This large-scale proposition is currently manageable because cloud computing is a relatively new
technology that requires a certain investment of time to master. If we are on the verge of a phase
transition to large-scale cloud adoption then we are in the calm before the storm. We want to 
take advantage of the comparative lull to create as many pathways and patterns to successful 
cloud adoption in preparation for the increase in migration volume. This NSF-sponsored project
has been a windfall enabling us to bring in students and staff towards this end. 


### Guiding report concepts


- Discussion of data resources
- Acquisition of data skills
- Emergence of career paths (data scientists) 
- New disciplines


### Cloud Computing Innovation and Cyber-Infrastructure Elements for Research Topics

- Data security
- Data sharing
- Computing at scale
- Institutional IT support for cloud adoption/migration
- Internet of Things in relation to the public cloud
- Student access to cloud platforms for research computing 
- Connectivity for high-speed data transfer from the lab to the cloud


### What is the impact on the development of the principal discipline(s) of the project?


To set the stage for our remarks on impact we describe a research transition to the cloud. 
Cloud computing represents a break with traditional research computing on 'owned resources'; 
and as such -- because of the perceived cost of change -- it requires considerable motivation 
to overcome social inertia. This motivation often originates from a desire to stop purchasing 
and maintaining computers. However the cloud has so many additional benefits that the 
inquisitive research team often finds there is more benefit from what the cloud *actually offers* 
than there is in *leaving behind* purchase orders and operating sytem patches. We call this
perceptual shift 'cloud socialization'.


A major impetus towards cloud socialization is the advent of cloud-hosted services, particularly
the *Git* paradigm for open source code control, for example as embodied by *GitHub* repositories. 


Describe how findings, results, techniques that were developed or extended, or other products from the project
made an impact or are likely to make an impact on the base of knowledge, theory, and research and/or pedagogical
methods in the principal disciplinary field(s) of the project. 8000 chars.

Be specific about how our efforts are driving a new approach to coordinated research at NASA in HIMAT.

### What is the impact on other disciplines? 

Describe how the findings, results or techniques that were developed or improved, or other products from the project
made an impact or are likely to make an impact on other disciplines. 8000 chars.

### What is the impact on the development of human resources? 


HR development in science, engineering and technology.


Prior notes abbreviating 'Dr. Fatland' as 'Rob': 


Rob's approach has been to *jump start* a community of practice and develop a growing toolkit of constructs for
UW faculty, staff and student researchers, specifically, AWS and Azure cloud resources. In so doing, he has identified and 
empowered researchers at all levels to acquire and share the skills neede to be effective CI engineers. 


Rob: Outreach projects: Close collaboration with eScience Institute: Accumulate and track a variety of research challenges
amenable to cloud. 


Rob: Paired these challenges with motivated staff and students. Wove beginnings of a resilient cloud-focused social 
fabric where researchers could come with problems; where researchers could access cloud tools and constructs needed. 
Collaborative support.


Challene: companies Boeing MSFT AWS Google


Rob has empowered and coached staff, graduate and undergrads to engage with admin and tech frameworks. AWS and Azure. 


### What is the impact on physical resources that form infrastructure? 


-- facilities, laboratories, instruments --


### What is the impact on institutional resources that form infrastructure? 

### What is the impact on informational resources that form infrastructure? 

### What is the impact on technology transfer?

-- commercial technology or public use --


### What is the impact on society beyond science and technology?
