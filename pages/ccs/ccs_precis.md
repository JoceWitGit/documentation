## Warnings

- ***This page is not regularly updated and may contain much that is wildly inaccurate. Contact us for updates.***
- ***We stay with topics and avoid names to maintain a degree of anonymity here. Contents on this 
page will be modified on request, usually within an hour or two during business hours. In some 
cases we do provide parenthetical salient project details such as funding agencies. ***
- ***Projects described may be in *any* degree of completion from 'twinkle in someone's eye' to
'published paper'.

## Medical research
- Laboratory Medicine: Cloud-based system for HIPAA compliant genome analysis including (oncology and related) clinical annotation

## Genomics
- Epigenome imputation: From existing wet lab experiments *infer* relationships between 
particular proteins and cell types as a function of location on the human genome
- Genomic patterns related to autism

## Molecular Engineering and Science

## Ocean science

## Hydrology and Geochemistry
- HiMAT (NASA)
- Dynamic Infomation Framework (World Bank)

## Computer Science

- Analysis of code fault detection: Student project
- IOT: A design pattern and tutorial for using cloud-based support of **Internet of Things** implementations 
(NSF: Campus Cyberinfrastructure)
- Data security on the cloud: A generic data system with automated and human protocols for working on sensitive
data including elements of compliance with oversight regulations 
(NSF: Campus Cyberinfrastructure)
- Scale on the cloud: See under Molecular Engineering and Science the protein folding case study
(NSF: Campus Cyberinfrastructure)
- Collaboration on the cloud: See case studies herein on GeoServer/THREDDS, on LIDAR, on Dynamic Information 
Frameworks and on HiMAT; thematically lightweight geospatial data system with the underlying theme of 'access 
to data through pre-built frameworks, data APIs and minimal (non-redundant) software engineering.
(NSF: Campus Cyberinfrastructure)

## Civil Engineering

## Mechanical Engineering

## Geospatial 
- Implementation of GeoServer and a THREDDS server on the public cloud

## Library science
