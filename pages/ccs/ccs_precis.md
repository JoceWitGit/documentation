## Warnings

- ***This page is not regularly updated and may contain much that is wildly inaccurate. Contact us for updates.***
- ***We stay with topics and avoid names to maintain a degree of anonymity here. Contents on this***
***page will be modified on request, usually within an hour or two during business hours. In some***
***cases we do provide parenthetical salient project details such as funding agencies. ***
- ***Projects described may be in *any* degree of completion from 'twinkle in someone's eye' to***
***'published paper'.***
