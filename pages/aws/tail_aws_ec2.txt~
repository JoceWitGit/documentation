Once you've associated the Elastic IP with a running instance, you can ssh into the VM with the Elastic IP but using the previous public key generated 
for the instance. Don't forget to update the vsftpd.conf with your new Elastic IP address which is now your public address.

```
> sudo vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
pasv_address=<Elastic IP address>
> sudo /etc/init.d/vsftpd restart
```

MS Azure on the other hand, let's you choose your on public DNS hostname which reduces the need for this workaround.

### DNS Hostnames

If you have your own registered domain, you can set your A-Record to point to the Elastic IP address of your instance. That gets rid of 
the unsightly public DNS that AWS assigns to you. Here's the example for cloudmaven.org (our domain registrar is Namecheap.com):

An A-record points the hostname (here "compute") to the AWS instance Elastic IP (here "52.41.144.22"). I 
can then ssh into my compute instance using ec2-user@compute.cloudmaven.org. You can also set up similarly 
an A record called ftp that points to the elastic IP of your ftp server instance to allow ftp 
access into say ftp.cloudmaven.org.
