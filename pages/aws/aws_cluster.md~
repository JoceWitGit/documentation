## Introduction

- Master: A VM charged with managing a cluster
- Worker: A VM charged with executing sub-processes
- Scheduler: Software that starts sub-processes within a compute task
- qsub: (Linux) submit a job to a processing queue
- qstat: (Linux) get queue status
- qdel: (Linux) delete a job from the queue
- host: List Worker nodes

## Warnings

- ***Assumed: You have an AWS account - sanitized***

## Let's Go!

- Start an EC2 instance 
  - It will be a 'base of operations'
  - It can therefore be small and cheap, for example a **T2.micro**.
  - Give it the Amazon Linux operating system e.g. Amazon Linux AMI
