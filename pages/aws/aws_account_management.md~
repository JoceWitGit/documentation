## Introduction

This page describes core AWS account management tasks in brief and then again in further detail. We assume that either
you are operating a research-credit based account provided directly from AWS or you are using a paid account established 
through the DLT third party provider. It is also possible for you to establish an account directly with AWS but this is
not recommended practice since DLT-based accounts provide some additional benefits.

## Warnings

## Task overview

- Set up your account to have "all green checkmarks". This means you are logged out and back in as an **admin**.
  - After a year or so you may be encouraged to 'rotate your access keys'; see the link provided above
- Start and Stop an EC2 instance: Know what it costs, what EBS is, and log in to it before you Stop it.
- Study up on cloud tech, enough to understand cost, security and capacity; and then make a plan.
