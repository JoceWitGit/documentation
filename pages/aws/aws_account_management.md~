## Task overview

- Set up your account to have "all green checkmarks". This means you are logged out and back in as an **admin**.
- Start and Stop an EC2 instance: Know what it costs, what EBS is, and log in to it before you Stop it.
- Study up on cloud tech, enough to understand cost, security and capacity; and then make a plan.
