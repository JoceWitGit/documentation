## Warnings
- ***The spot market is a key element of being cost effective on the AWS public
cloud. There is a tradeoff, however: You will need to learn enough about how 
the spot market works to accomplish two things: First secure the resources you
need for your computing task at the reduced cost and second not securing more
resources than you intend (for example in an automated cluster spin-up) which
can deplete your budget.***
- ***The AWS VM pool is huge. It is a mistake to equate that pool to the spot 
market pool. The latter is considerably smaller; so there are commensurate
'constrained resource' patterns to be aware of.***
